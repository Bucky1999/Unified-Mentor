Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Neural Network Autoencoder
1. Objective:
The system detects anomalies (fraudulent transactions) by identifying patterns that deviate significantly 
from normal behavior using a neural network autoencoder. The following key processes are achieved:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Creation and Training
4. Anomaly Detection
5. Result Visualization and Export
2. Key Components:
A. Class: Fraud Detection
The Fraud Detection class modularizes the system, enabling scalability and reusability.
B. Methods and Their Roles:
- Trains the autoencoder using mean squared error (MSE) loss.
- Purpose: The autoencoder learns to reconstruct normal transactions accurately.
- Computes reconstruction errors for all transactions.
- Flags anomalies where errors exceed a threshold (default: top 1% errors).
- Adds an anomaly column to the dataset (1 = anomaly, 0 = normal).
- Visualizes anomalies on a scatterplot, showing their geographical distribution (longitude and latitude).
3. Key Points in the Code:
1. Feature Engineering:
- Adding transaction percentage enhances the model's ability to identify unusually large transactions 
relative to the credit limit.
2. Neural Network:
- The autoencoder uses compression (encoder) and reconstruction (decoder) to measure how well each 
transaction matches the learned patterns.
3. Threshold for Anomalies:
- The reconstruction error threshold is dynamically calculated using the 99th percentile. This ensures 
flexibility in defining what constitutes an anomaly.
4. Visualization:
- Geographic scatterplots help analyze fraud locations, aiding in actionable insights for analysts.
4. Results
1. The system outputs:
- A dataset with anomaly labels.
- Visualizations for understanding fraud distribution.
2. Results are saved to a CSV file (fraud_detection_results.csv) for further analysis.
5. How This Solves the Problem
- Scalable and Modular: The class structure makes it easy to adapt to new datasets or additional 
features.
- Anomaly Detection: The autoencoder effectively identifies unusual patterns without needing labeled 
data.
- Insights for Action: Visualizations and anomaly labels allow data analysts to focus on potential fraud 
cases.
Suggestions for Further Improvement:
- Real-time Detection: Integrate the model into a pipeline for real-time fraud monitoring.
- Threshold Tuning: Allow domain experts to adjust the anomaly threshold dynamically.
- Add More Features: Incorporate additional attributes like transaction time or frequency.
